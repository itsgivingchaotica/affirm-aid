            <p>When you give to Affirm/Aid montly, you will directly enable us to provide the funds needed to aid access to services and aftercare that is often overlooked by insurance companies. Such essentials include laser hair removal, lymphatic massages, non-surgical facial and body treatments and injections, voice therapy, as well as surgical aftercare supplies: all essential to the mental health of trans folks. In an era where trans* rights are under attack, we wholeheartedly believe in providing support directly to the individuals who continue to make progress and live in their truth. That's why we have made it our mission to bridge the financial gap and provide crucial support to individuals seeking gender-affirming care. </p>
