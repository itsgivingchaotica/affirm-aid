            <h1>What we do</h1>
            <p>From funding gender-affirming treatments to providing a platform to provide inter-community support, we are committed to ensuring that no one is left behind or swallowed into debt.</p>
            <br>

            <br><br>
            <p>We collaborate with healthcare providers, therapists, and other professionals who specialize in transgender healthcare to ensure that the services provided are safe, inclusive, and affirming. Additionally, we offer educational programs and workshops to raise awareness about transgender issues and promote acceptance and understanding within communities. Our ultimate goal is to create a society where gender-affirming services are accessible and affordable for all transgender individuals, helping them live their lives with dignity, self-confidence, and the freedom to be their authentic selves.</p>
            <br>
            <p>At Affirm/Aid, we understand that proper healing and recovery require access to specialized products and resources. Through our innovative programs and partnerships, we strive to provide a wide range of services that are often overlooked or excluded by insurance providers and seek to ensure that individuals have access to the necessary supplies such as over-the-counter medications and supplies, compression garments, mobility aids, specialty health foods, after-surgery support pillows, and more. These items not only promote physical healing but also contribute to a sense of comfort and well-being during the recovery process.

            <br>
            <p>In addition to aftercare supplies, we actively support individuals in accessing accommodations for surgeries. We understand that undergoing a surgical procedure can be a significant life event, and having a safe and supportive environment is crucial for optimal recovery. Whether it's assisting with finding suitable post-surgery housing, coordinating transportation to and from medical facilities, or connecting individuals with temporary caregivers, we work diligently to provide the necessary resources and support to ensure a smooth and successful recovery process.</p>
