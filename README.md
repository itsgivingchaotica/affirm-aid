## About the webpage

The goal of Affirm Aid is to fundraise at the grassroots level for gender-affirming services. 
These services are often inaccessible to many individuals in the trans community because of their high costs.
Even post-surgical requirements and supplies are often overlooked as huge expenses.
This webpage is a prototype for the nonprofit so fundraise and inform the public about its mission and ask for monthly donations.
